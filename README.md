# robot-luxo

Rendition of Pixar's Luxo Jr. with servo mounts, an IMU, and a Raspberry Pi. Using to explore reinforcement learning. The intent is for it to actually jump and move around. Work in progress. This repo heavily under construction.

## Software setup

### 0. Get the image

Download [Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS](http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/releases/18.04.5/release/) for Raspberry Pi 3 32-bit (aka "hard float"). The Pi 3 image will work on a Pi 4.

I don't know if 64-bit works with the entire stack, let me know if you try.

### 1. Set up Wi-Fi

Login in with user ubuntu, password ubuntu, and edit this file:

```
sudo nano 50-cloud-init.yaml
```

Add this to the file:

```
    wifis:
        wlan0:
            optional: true
            access-points:
                "YOUR-SSID-NAME":
                    password: "YOUR-NETWORK-PASSWORD"
            dhcp4: true
```

Check for errors in the config:

```
sudo netplan â€“debug try
```

Apply the config:

```
sudo netplan --debug apply
sudo reboot
```

After this your device should be online.

### 2. Install the system

```
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y git
git clone https://github.com/dheera/robot-luxo
cd robot-luxo
system/install.sh
```
